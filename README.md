Project Description
Ecommerce-Follow-Along is a comprehensive project designed to guide developers through the process of building an e-commerce application from scratch. This project will cover various aspects of web development, including front-end design, back-end integration, and database management, providing a hands-on learning experience.

Milestone 1: Project Overview
In this session, we focused on the foundational elements of the Ecommerce-Follow-Along project. Key topics covered included:

1. Project Setup
We initialized the GitHub repository and set up the basic structure for our application.
2. Technology Stack
An overview of the technologies that will be utilized throughout the project:
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for the back-end.
Express.js: Web framework for building the back-end API.
MongoDB: NoSQL database to store application data.
React (MUI): Front-end framework using React with Material-UI for UI components.
3. Version Control
Introduction to Git and GitHub for version control.
Emphasized best practices for committing code and managing branches.
4. Development Environment
Configuration of local development environments to ensure consistency across team members.
milstone 5 created signup page.
- The **Sign-Up page** is where users can create an account by entering their name, email, and password.
- **Form validation** checks that the data users enter is correct, like ensuring the email is in the right format and the password is strong enough.
- In Milestone 5, you’ll design the sign-up form, add validation to make sure the data is accurate, and ensure a smooth user experience.
- Once you’re done, push your code to GitHub, update the README with your progress, and share the repository link for submission.

milestone 4:-
User Model:

A User Model defines the structure of user data in the database using MongoDB schemas (e.g., name, email, password, and other fields). It acts as a blueprint for how data is stored and validated.
User Controller:

A User Controller manages user-related operations, such as handling user sign-up, login, and other requests. It interacts with the User Model to perform actions like creating, fetching, or updating user data.
File Uploads with Multer:

Multer is used to handle file uploads (e.g., profile pictures) in your backend. It stores files and tracks them on the server, making it easy to manage user-uploaded content.


milestone 6:-
1. Encrypt the Password:
Use bcrypt to hash the user’s password during the signup process.
Make sure you never save the plain text password in the database, only the hashed version.
2. Store Complete User Data:
Ensure you’re saving all relevant user information (like name, email, etc.) to the database.
While saving, make sure the password is always encrypted (hashed with bcrypt) and never stored as plain text.
3. Missed the Mentor-Led Session?:
No worries if you couldn’t attend the live coding session! You can always refer to the content and work through the steps.
If you get stuck on the coding aspect, feel free to reach out to your mentor for guidance.
Once you’ve completed these steps:
1. Push Your Code:
Push your updated code to the same GitHub repository you used for the previous milestones.
2. Make Your Repository Public:
Ensure your repository is publicly accessible so that your mentor can review it.
3. Update Your README:
Add a new section in your README to summarize the progress you've made for Milestone 6.
4. Share the Link:
Once everything is updated, share the repository link in the assignment submission section provided.
