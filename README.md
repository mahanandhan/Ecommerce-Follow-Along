milstone 5 created signup page.
- The **Sign-Up page** is where users can create an account by entering their name, email, and password.
- **Form validation** checks that the data users enter is correct, like ensuring the email is in the right format and the password is strong enough.
- In Milestone 5, you’ll design the sign-up form, add validation to make sure the data is accurate, and ensure a smooth user experience.
- Once you’re done, push your code to GitHub, update the README with your progress, and share the repository link for submission.
